odrviewer is a simple application for viewing OpenDRIVE files.

Optionally it can populate the road lanes with randomized dummy vehicles, which will go until end of road then starting over from initial position. If reaching a junction with multiple options, it will randomly chose its way out.

Application is launched from command line (or batch file). 

Usage: odrviewer [options]

  --version
      Show version and quit

Additional OSG graphics options:
  --clear-color <color>         Set the background color of the viewer in the form "r,g,b[,a]"
  --screen <num>                Set the screen to use when multiple screens are present
  --window <x y w h>            Set the position (x,y) and size (w,h) of the viewer window
  --borderless-window <x y w h> Set the position(x, y) and size(w, h) of a borderless viewer window

Examples:

1. View the ODR file and some random traffic on a 3D model, window mode 1000 x 500:
   odrviewer --odr xodr\e6mini.xodr --model models\e6mini.osgb --window 60 60 1000 500

2. Just ODR, fullscreen
   odrviewer --odr xodr\e6mini.xodr

3. Remove traffic
   odrviewer --odr xodr\e6mini.xodr --model models\e6mini.osgb --density 0 --window 60 60 1000 500

4. Sparse traffic (about 0.5 vehicle per 100 meter = 1 per 200 m)
   odrviewer --odr xodr\e6mini.xodr --model models\e6mini.osgb --density 0.5 --window 60 60 1000 500

           - Orbit        (camera facing vehicle, rotating around it)
           - Fixed        (fix rotation, always straight behind vehicle)
           - Flex         (imagine the camera attached to vehicle via an elastic string)
           - Flex - orbit (Like flex but allows for roatation around vehicle)
           - Top          (top view, fixed rotation, always straight above vehicle)
